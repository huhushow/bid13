question 2
goal : generate a scatter plot image from CSV
what component I need?

1. loader - should be handle various file format
2. plot class that generate plot image
   1. but I think JS is better option to generate image
   2. so maybe this class generate both data for RestAPI and image
3. since I don't know how to display or save this plot image, I just return handle of temp file
